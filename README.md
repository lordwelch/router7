router7 is a pure-Go implementation of a small home internet router. It comes with all the services required to make a [fiber7 internet connection](https://www.init7.net/en/internet/fiber7/) work (DHCPv4, DHCPv6, DNS, etc.).

Note that this project should be considered a (working!) tech demo. Feature requests will likely not be implemented, and see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details about which contributions are welcome.
